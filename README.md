# Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree
**Become a Front-End Web Developer by completing a variety of projects for your portfolio - become an HTML, CSS and JavaScript pro!**

You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.
