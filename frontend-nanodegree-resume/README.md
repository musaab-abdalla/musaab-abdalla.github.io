# Online Resume

###### Overview

In this project you will store your resume data in four javaScript objects. As is often the case when leveraging an API, the objects must follow the schema exactly. All properties must be present and have real or fake values. The names must match those in the schema (note that object and property names are case-sensitive). All property values should be of the data-type given for the property in the schema. For example if the data-type is given as an array, it is not acceptable to use a string as a value for that property. Once you've created your javaScript objects, you will write the code needed to display all of the resume data contained within these objects in your resume. All of the HTML code needed to build the resume is stored in `js/helper.js` variables. The variable names indicate their function. You will replace substrings in these variable string values such as `%data%` and `#` with the data in your javaScript objects, and `append` or `prepend` the formatted result to your resume in the appropriate location. <br/>
